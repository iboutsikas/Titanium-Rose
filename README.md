# Titanium Rose
This is a graphics engine built to explore decoupled rendering as a techinique.

# Hazel origins
The project started out as a very old fork of
[Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) and engine developed primarily by
[Yan Chernikov](https://github.com/TheCherno). While the scope and purpose of
the engine has heavily diverged since then, and the renderer is completely
different you can still find some familiar layouts and code, especially on the
application layer. As such, a huge thank you goes out to the original engine and
the community around it!
